# MinecraftConnectsDiscord - Discord Integration for Minecraft! 
Connect your Minecraft in game chat to Discord!

Minecraft and Discord chats are together! This piece of plugin integrates your server's in-game chat to your defined discord text channel. Simple.

Config file allows you to change,

* Player Join Message
* Player Disconnect Message
* Server Start Message
* Server Stop Message
* Discord Server Invite Link

Commands are (only for OPs):

* /discord fast : Fast Reload without changing the Bot Token
* /discord full : Full Reload, restarts bot

If default player tries "/discord", he will receive the discord invitation link which is configurable at config file!
Config file located at "/discord/config.ini", it generates itself at first run.
To be able to use this in your Spigot Server,

* You have to create a Discord Bot via https://discordapp.com/developers/ (its free)
* You have to have a Discord Server.

Get your Discord Bot's TOKEN and invite the bot to your Discord Server. Put the TOKEN in to the config file.
Open Discord's Developer Mode. Right click the text channel which you want to integrate with Minecraft Chat. Minecraft Chat will be mirrored to that text channel. And click "Copy ID", also put it in to config file.
